# Virtual Dave

Virtual Dave is a fully open-source deepfake pipeline that converts text into lifelike video of “Dave” speaking. It integrates:

1. **Voice Extraction**: isolate Dave’s speech from source videos  
2. **Voice Conversion (RVC)**: train a custom model to convert any voice into Dave’s voice  
3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: generate raw audio from text  
4. **Lip Sync (Wav2Lip)**: sync the generated audio with Dave’s mouth movements
